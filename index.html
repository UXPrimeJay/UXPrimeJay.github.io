                        I am a current student at Minneapolis College for software Developer associates degree. I plan to transfer to a 4 year Universty after my 2 years at Metro State University for Cyber Security. Though, before I can transfer, I am working on transferable coding language skills that would help me in the long run. That is, I am learning through Udemy and Youtube for projects I can create to build my portfolio while learning. In my spare time, I like to play video games and make music. Currently I play the piano and still continuing to take professonal lessons. <br>
                        <br> Curious, with a motivated growth mindset to achive and give value towards people and technology.
